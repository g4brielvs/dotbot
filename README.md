# dotfiles

If you use OS X or Linux on your desktop/servers, you may be at a point where you have configured a lot of your own settings, configurations, or themes within dotfiles. For the uninformed, dotfiles are files in your home directory that begin with a dot, or full-stop character. This indicates to the operating system that they are hidden files, used to set configuration settings for tools like vim, or shells such as bash and zsh to name a few.
